* *What the project does?*  
I decided to post all my starting programms on here, so it probably does nothing.  
* *Why the project is useful?*  
It is useful mostly for me: I need to learn how to use Github, plus everybody says that beginners need to post their works as often as possible. 

I will be adding all the little projects I've done so far plus new ones right after I create them.

If someone wishes to critise my code or suggest better improvements - please, do not hesitate. That's one of the main reasons I'm creating this. 

All the code was written by me. You may use it whenever and however you want, but I doubt you would need to.
